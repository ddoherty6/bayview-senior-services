										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Organizations like ours are essential to the quality of life in any community. We are deeply engaged with the community’s seniors, and care for them with the dignity, respect and honor they deserve. The agency – which provides safe and welcoming places where seniors find care, companionship, and essential support service – is a lively community focal point, providing elders with nutrition programs, health screenings, rehabilitation services, money management advice, networking opportunities and adult day health care &#8212; as well as our nationally recognized senior ex-offender program.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The goal of SEOP, to help ex-offenders re-engage in the community, would not be met without first finding housing.  Therefore BHPMSS provides two transitional homes that give ex-offenders a chance to live in the community with support systems.</p>
